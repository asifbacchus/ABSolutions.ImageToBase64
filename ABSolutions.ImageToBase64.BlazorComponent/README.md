# ImageToBase64: Blazor Component

This is an implementation of the `ABSolutions.ImageToBase64` library service as a Blazor component. It is a simple
component that takes care of all the implementation required to call the backend library which retrieves and converts
an image to a Base64-encoded string. The component then generates a valid `img` tag with the `src` attribute set to the
Base64-encoded string and includes any additional configured attributes.
